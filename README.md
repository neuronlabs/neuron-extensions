# Neuron Extensions
Neuron extensions is the repository that contains examples for the **golang** framework `Neuron` - [github.com/neuronlabs/neuron](https://github.com/neuronlabs/neuron).

### Development Tool

Main package contains [Cobra](github.com/spf13/cobra) CLI, that allows to set the submodules in development mode.
This way it's much easier to work on the current neuron changes and all related submodules.
For more info type go run main.go --help
